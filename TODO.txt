TODO list - a centralized list of stuff I'd like to do
(in roughly priority order, *-marked means done)
===========================================================

 - Move helper functions to sub-module
    - Add functions that check etag, last modified date, and then halt() with Not Modified if they match
    - Helpers for other stuff?
        - expires(some time value)
        - cache_control(various params, e.g. public=True/False, max_age=60, must_revalidate=True/False)
    - Look in to if-match and if-none-match headers to see how we handle them
    - redirect_back helper that is a wrapper around redirect() and the referrer?
 - URL generation that properly handles different mountpoints
 - Integrate with Shift
 - Session support - should allow hooking into this, so we can use e.g. beaker, or something like dogpile, just a cookie, etc
 * Test URL params/args in before()/after()/condition functions
 * Tests for the various helper functions and underlying exceptions
 * Allow arbitrary parameters to be passed to HaltRoutingException
 * Implement redirect() in a sensible manner
 - More logging
 - Automation (e.g. bump version, test, deploy, etc. - as a Fabfile?)
 - Upload to PyPI
   - Fix author/author_email
   * MANIFEST.in
   * README.txt^H^H^H^H.md
 - Template library integration (look at Tilt for Ruby - something similar for Python would be nice)
 - Examples
   - Middleware examples (e.g. security, stuff like that?)
   - File upload example
   - Simple hello-world
   - Larger app (todo list like everyone else?)
 - Integration examples
   - Beaker
   - Some sort of DB (SqlAlchemy?)


Longer-Term TODOs
===========================================================

 - Python 3 port (I like Python 3.3, would like to switch to it, but target 3.0/3.1+)
 - File uploads are currently non-ideal
