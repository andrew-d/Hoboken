New Todo
===========================================================
 - Configuration stuff:
    ! Lock to serialize all requests (in case app is not thread-safe)
    - Charset/encoding stuff
    ! Static / template directories.
 - Cookie support
    - In HTTP objects, cookie parsing
    - In Hoboken, use itsdangerous to do secure cookies
 - Static file support
 - Make the upload limits in our request body parser actually do something
 - Testing helpers:
    - Should have useful things like:
        - assert_has_header
        - assert_body
        - etc.
    - Should work with no external dependencies.
    - Maybe use inspect module to verify function signatures.
 - sendfile() support
 - Proxy objects
    - Something like `from hoboken.proxies import request, response`, which are
      then actually bound to the current application's request.  Needs to be
      [green]thread-safe, should support nested applications.
      Will be useful to save typing.
 - Examples
 - Documentation (inline, with Sphinx)
 - Maybe:
    - Session support, with pluggable session handlers
        - Maybe make an extension
        - Test with Beaker / Dogpile
    - Asset pipeline
    - WSGI adapters, similar to Bottle, so we can do `run(server='foo')`
    - Look into handling range requests.  Maybe make it that one can return
      an object that supports slicing `foo[10:20]`, and then a helper function
      that will only send the correct range.



More planning:
  - Want to be able to modify cookies by using something that approximates a
    normal dict().  Something like: req.cookies['name'] = b'val'
  - Problem: modifying the cookies array, or modifying the attributes on the
    cookie won't notify the request to re-serialize headers.  Need to be
    notified when something changes so we can re-serialize headers.
  - Also a problem: headers don't support multiple items properly.
  - If we use a MultiDict() for headers, it doesn't support modifying the key
    when accessed - this is since I want to support indexing headers with
    either a binary or text type (i.e. b'foo' or u'foo').

Possible solutions:
  - MutableMapping-based CallbackDict that will callback whenever a dictionary
    entry is modified.
  - Similar to above, MutableSequence-based CallbackList.
  - Modify MultiDict to be based on MutableMapping, have functions
    __keytransform__ and __valuetransform__ that will modify keys/values.
