TODO list - a centralized list of stuff I'd like to do
(in roughly priority order)
===========================================================

 - Test URL params/args in before()/after()/condition functions
 - Tests for the various helper functions and underlying exceptions
 - Allow arbitrary parameters to be passed to HaltRoutingException
 - Implement redirect() in a sensible manner
 - More logging
 - Automation (e.g. bump version, test, deploy, etc. - as a Fabfile?)
 - Upload to PyPI
   - Fix author/author_email
   - MANIFEST.in
   - README.txt
 - Template library integration (look at Tilt for Ruby - something similar for Python would be nice)
 - Examples
   - Middleware examples (e.g. security, stuff like that?)
   - File upload example
   - Simple hello-world
   - Larger app (todo list like everyone else?)
 - Integration examples
   - Beaker
   - Some sort of DB (SqlAlchemy?)


Longer-Term TODOs
===========================================================

 - Python 3 port (I like Python 3.3, would like to switch to it, but target 3.0/3.1+)
 - File uploads are currently non-ideal
